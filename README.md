# The Body at the Dorm Party

There's been a murder at the dorm party, and Detective Amina is on the case. Interview the colorful cast of characters and review evidence to figure out who did it!


### Matthew's documentation

For this project, I built the website and played one of the characters. I pushed myself to make the website as responsive as possible, even though that wasn't a requirement. I think I mostly succeeded! Flexbox was incredibly helpful for this, and my newfound mastery of Flexbox will definitely be very useful in future web projects.

Every time I wrangle with HTML and CSS, I learn about a new quirk of the languages. Apparently, spaces matter when calling classes in CSS â€“ saying ".popup .active" calls an "active" element within a "popup" element, while ".popup.active" calls an element that has both "active" and "popup" classes. When I figured this out I had one of those moments where everything clicked and I simultaneously felt like a genius and a neanderthal.

I also worked on a lot of the (janky) art assets for the webpage, including the sketch on the landing page (which is actually a bunch of animation frames from Illustrator painstakingly exported one-by-one) and the evidence board assets. 

One thing I'm proud of is that I am finally reaching a level where I'm fairly confident in my understanding of HTML and CSS. For the first few projects I felt like I was just flailing around until things worked, but now I can actually say I understand most of what I'm doing. I'm relying a lot less on online tutorials (although they're still a great resource). I remember wondering at the start of the semester why we weren't supposed to use Bootstrap since I felt it would have made things easier. Now I understand why! 

The JS for this project was pretty simple. Popups are a big part of how this experience is navigated,
